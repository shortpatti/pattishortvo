# About

My journey is about finding myself. I’m a free spirit, and in a cruel world like ours, I have felt small and inadequate most of my life. Until now, my free spirit, which we’ll call ‘Tori,’ has been dragging a tin cup across the bars of the jail cell for more than a decade. Oh, and she’s a feisty one too. She’s already revolted and now ready for a full-blown prison break to freedom!
