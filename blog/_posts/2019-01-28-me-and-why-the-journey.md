# Who am I and why the journey?

I’m a creative thinker who fell into a rigid and dull profession to keep a roof over mine and my child’s head. I’m a single woman who never married and has done everything in my power to survive.

For the last 22 years, I’ve been a technical writer whose audience has primarily been IT professionals: help desk, system administrators, and network engineers. In 2010, I realized I was starting to hate the profession, but due to the economy, I had no choice but to stay in the trade to survive. Sadly, today’s economy isn’t that great either, but I’m determined to get out of the profession.  

Well, my past few employers have sucked the life out of me. Seriously!! I have now come to hate the profession. They broke me. They broke me bad!! Now think of the movie “The Warriors.” Well, they cut me bad! I feel that the tech writing industry is full of gangs. “Warriors, come out and playay!!” So much competition, and there doesn’t need to be.  

BUT!!!! Being laid off from the last employer was a HUGE blessing in disguise. I discovered a hidden talent and now have professionals, in the business, coaching me. They see my potential! And they are genuinely excited for me.  

So! My journey, at the age of 51, is to change careers and have fun along the way!!!  

Follow me to find out where I'm going and what obstacles I’ve faced or are facing.
