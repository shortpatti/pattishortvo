# What are the obstacles on my journey?

I have to admit that there are several obstacles in my way and IT IS TERRIFYING!

Well for starters, I’ve been unemployed since November 2018, and my previous employer has denied me the right to collect unemployment. What this means is I may be crashing on someone’s couch, and I am downsizing for this reason. Having just what clothes you can pack in a suitcase or two and your laptop makes it easier when it’s eviction time.

Not having an income means that I WILL NOT be able to continue with my voice over coaching, which makes me sad and angry.

- I’m **sad** because I feel like I’m finally catching a break on a new profession that I could have fun doing and finally enjoy myself for once.

- I’m **mad** because it always comes down to money, which means it comes down to deciding whether to pay rent or pay for these voice lessons.

Another obstacle I’m facing is ageism. I’m fighting discrimination, and, in my case, it’s a double-edged sword. The other side of the sword is my gender. Yes, I said it!!! No, this is not a pity party; I’m stating the facts. The older I get, the harder it will be to find or keep a job! My position at my last job was supposedly eliminated, but in reality, I was replaced with “fresh out of college” English majors.

It’s still a journey, none the less! It’s how I face tackling these obstacles along the way that makes a difference.
