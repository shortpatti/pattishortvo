# Where am I going from here?

One day, out of complete exhaustion from rewriting my resume and cover letters for each job I applied to, I took a chance.

What was it that I took a chance on, you ask? I clicked on a link about voice over. Next thing I knew, I was given a couple of commercial scripts and a narrative script and then I was evaluated by a voice over coach. OMG! So pumped and excited because he said that my voice is powerful and informative. Not authoritative, but knowledgable and informative.

Oh, he also said I’m a natural at analyzing scripts. I admit that I have written scripts in the past for video tutorials but have never done the voice over for the final product; just the prototype.

My coaching officially starts on March 2, 2019, and I couldn’t be more thrilled to have a voice actor from the gaming industry. My demo tracks should be cut in late June early July, and then marketing starts to promote me.

BUT, It’s important for me to work through some obstacles that I’m facing. So, what are the obstacles on my journey? Find out in my next post.
