# The fight for equality

I'm smart. I'm creative. I'm passionate.  That's all fine and dandy, but it doesn't mean a thing!  Something a bit more descriptive would be, most men don't like working with women because in their pea brained minds women are stupid.

I work in a male-dominated industry and I've experienced discrimination and gas lighting.  I know for a fact that a man with an English degree working as technical writer with less experience than me will ALWAYS, ALWAYS, get paid at least &#36;20K more per year.  I also know that a man who has 3 years of experience in tech writing will automatically get the Senior Tech Writer title.  It makes me mad because I've been a technical writer for 23 years.  The other tech writer at my job has only been a tech writer for the last 3 years.  My knowledge and expertise are not wanted.  

I have been the glorified receptionist for far too long.  I am not like the majority of technical writers out there; I actually have a technical degree and have worked as an IT professional (hands on experience).  I have great ideas for how documentation should be structured.  I am sorry people find my ideas radical, but they aren't.  They are realistic because I always have efficiency and user experience in the back of my mind.
