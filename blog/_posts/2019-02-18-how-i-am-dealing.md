# How AM I dealing with these obstacles?

So let’s recap. Shall we!!  One obstacle on my journey is that I’m unemployed and don’t qualify for unemployment. The other obstacle is that I’m fighting ageism, which is, in my opinion, flat out discrimination.

I have to admit, these obstacles are pretty damn stressful.  I’ve had a couple of full-blown meltdowns just last week alone.   Yes!  It took a full-blown meltdown and the people who care about me to get it all out of my system so that I could focus my energy on getting THAT job I worked so hard to get! 

YEP!!! You read that correctly.  I landed the job I wanted.  I stressed out hardcore with the interview process because, hmmm, let’s see, I had:

- An unscheduled meeting with a person on the team during the in-person interview after the initial phone screening.  It was 10 minutes but I got through it because apparently, I made it to the next phase of the interview process; two more interviews. 

- Nailed the next interview, but didn’t think I did so well in the last interview.  Well, guess what?  I made it to the final phase (yes, phase four) with the writing test that included an analysis of what I would do to improve their documentation and a code snippet that I wrote for a specific topic of theirs.

- Completed the analysis with a ton of confidence and wrote some code sample, in JavaScript (a language I’m not strong in).  That was a bit stressful, but it’s the kind of stress that drives me.  Well, the next day I see an email in my inbox telling me to try the code sample again, and to take my time.  OMG!!!  That was the beginning of my meltdown!

Instantly, I thought that “Shit, I’m so screwed because now they don’t think I’m technical enough!”  At this point, I’d been applying to at least three jobs per day for the last 3½ months and getting rejected.  I was either not technical enough (that is, NOT qualified) or I was asking for too much (that is, OVER qualified).  Oh, and then throw ageism on top of that; I was not having the greatest day. 

That day, in particular, was a late start for the colleges due to the bad snowstorm that hit the Pacific Northwest, my son was home and was able to bring me back down to earth (kind of) so that he could help me figure it out.  Instead of JavaScript, I just did a PHP code snippet. My son looked at it to see if I was going in the right direction.  To be honest, we weren’t sure if my code snippet was adequate enough.  

That was a Thursday afternoon, and I canceled an interview I had that afternoon to complete the second code sample.  I’m not quite sure what I did on Thursday night.  All I know is I woke up the next morning and as the day progressed and I hadn’t heard anything, I started to panic. The panic was heightened by the fact that my previous employer denied my unemployment.  

I was scared!  I was terrified. I’m not sure what happened but next thing I knew I was in a heightened state of panic and went to Facebook.  I guess that wasn’t a great idea, considering my current state of mind.  That afternoon was the tipping point, but my son and his girlfriend were able to bring me back down to earth and treated me to dinner.  I think part of it was cabin fever too because we were all snowed in (the Seattle area is not used to heavy snow). 

After dinner, my son and his girlfriend gave me some ideas to get through the weekend to keep my mind off of my situation.  So here’s what I did to deal with these obstacles…
- Saturday, I did something creative.  I am building an organization board so I stapled batting and fabric to cork boards.  
- Sunday, I PURGED PERSONAL BELONGINGS!!!  I ended up with 10 small moving boxes full of MY things that I didn’t want anymore or no longer use.  I took a break from purging and did some praying and letting go.

Well, on Sunday afternoon at around 2:00 pm the recruiter called to offer me the job. We discussed the next steps, such as background check paperwork.  The company is observing President’s Day, so my offer letter should show up sometime this afternoon (Monday) or early the next day. 

My tentative start date is the first Monday in March, two weeks from today!  YAY!!!  I have two weeks to finally take care of me, do something relaxing, and get going on my voice over lessons!
