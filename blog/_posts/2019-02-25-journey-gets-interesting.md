# This journey is getting even more exciting!!!

I have two main goals for this journey: learn a new skill to protect my right to earn a living and get to a healthy weight.  Now that I have accepted a job offer and have started to onboard, and my mind is a bit more at ease, I can start focusing on my voice over lessons and getting to a healthy weight.

All my life I’ve struggled with my weight. I fell and shattered my right wrist and separated my left shoulder. I lost mobility and was sedentary for quite some time after my accident. In the Spring of 2015 I set forth to lose weight. By late 2015, I had lost 50 lbs and was feeling great. But then, not long after moving to Seattle, I gained more than 50 lbs.  Several factors are at play here:

1. About 5 weeks into the new job, my manager went bat-shit crazy and called me a “piece of shit” during a 1:1. THAT alone put me in a bad place! My mental state was at it’s worse...I became suicidal!!!  I have never been that bad and it was terrifying! I did, however, figure out later why she had that management style.  
2. The new Orthopedic surgeon, what was a referral from the doctor in Denver, took his time to assess the injury and said that it was bad and time for a new wrist.  The surgery was about 6 months to the day after I moved to the area and 18½ months AFTER shattering my wrist.
3. The first surgery didn’t take. Nope, not successful.  At this point, after the surgery, I felt that every time I had a question for the surgeon I wasn’t getting his undivided attention. So, I switched surgeons at the suggestion of my occupational therapist, and eventually had another surgery.
4. The second surgery was a success, but I will no longer gain full mobility the first surgery was supposed to. I ended up having a partial fusion, so my right wrist (dominant hand) does not bend forwards or backwards, or from side to side. 

I have been sedentary since that fall that shattered my wrist in August 2014 and I have quite a bit of muscle atrophy. It's been a long recovery and the back story of my injury hasn't helped.  It’s a long story, but to shorten it up, the hospital and doctor who initially treated me in Denver failed at their job.  I was told it was a sprained wrist. Trying to get a doctor to reassess the injury was a frustrating process, but I found eventually found one in the area.  

I’m also an emotional eater so my weight just exploded.  I did, however, at the end of 2016, start to lose the weight again.  But DAMMIT!  Wouldn’t you believe it? I got fired from my job and gained all that weight back.  Wow!  So disappointing.  Luckily, I’ve maintained the weight but I don’t want to maintain a weight that is so UNHEALTHY!!!

So, to cut this story short, I’m adding to my journey, at 51, eating healthier and exercising more.
